## Setup

<!-- - Clone this project into your favourite directory! You will have two directories, `server` and `client`
- Change directory into `server` and run `bundle install` and then `rake db:reset` to set up the Rails API server and load preset project data. 
- While in the server directory, run `rails s` to start the API server. This should run on `localhost:3000`
- Change directories to the `client` directory. 
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the client. 
- To find all the search treasures, get a free trial API key from SerpApi and turn the .env.example into a real .env file. 
- To start the client, run `npm start` and when prompted, allow react to choose its own localhost port to run on. 
- Navigate to the given port, and have fun!  -->
